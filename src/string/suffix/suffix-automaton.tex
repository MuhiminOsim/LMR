Usage:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{head}: The first state.
\item \texttt{tail}: The last state. Terminating states can be reached via visiting the ancestors of tail.
\item \texttt{len}: The longest length of the string in the state. The shortest one is \texttt{parent -> len + 1}.
\item \texttt{first}: The first location in the string where the state can be reached.
\item \texttt{cnt}: The number of times a particular substring $S$ of substrings corresponding to the state appears.
\item \texttt{parent}: the parent link. A larger set of all matching possibilities.
\item \texttt{go}: the automaton link.
\end{enumerate}
