Maximum matching for general weighted graphs in $O(n^3)$ (1-based).

Usage: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set $n$ to the size of the vertices.
\item Execute \texttt{init}.
\item Set \texttt{g[][].w} to the weight of the edges.
\item Execute \texttt{solve}.
\item The first result is the answer, the second one is the number of matching pairs. Obtain the exact matching with \texttt{match[]}.
\end{enumerate}
