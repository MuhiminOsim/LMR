# LMR
Luna's Magic Reference

## Description
Intended to be a detailed reference for ICPC contests, or for programming contests in general. This reference is aimed for regional-final level competition/Codeforces Div.1 contests, so some simpler algorithms (Shortest Path, etc.) are not included.

## Progress
Done. Feel free to fork it for your own likeness, and do tell me if you find some bugs or have a piece of code that fits within the context!
